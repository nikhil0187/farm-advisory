            <div class="technique">
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <img src="drip.png" alt="Drip Irrigation">
                <p>Drip irrigation delivers water directly to the plant roots through a network of pipes and emitters, minimizing water loss through evaporation and runoff.  It is a highly efficient method.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="technique">
                <h3>Suitable Conditions</h3>
                <p>Best for: Arid and semi-arid regions, areas with water scarcity, and uneven terrains.</p>
                <p>Crops: Orchards, vineyards, vegetables (tomatoes, peppers), and high-value crops.</p>
                <p>Land Area: Suitable for small to large fields.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="technique">
                <h3>Expenses & Resources</h3>
                <p>Initial Cost: High (pipes, emitters, filters, pumps).</p>
                <p>Resources: Reliable water source, pump, filtration system, technical expertise.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="technique">
                <h3>Labor Needs</h3>
                <p>Low operational labor, high skilled labor for design, installation, and maintenance.</p>

            <h2>Sprinkler Irrigation</h2>
            <div class="technique">
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <img src="sprinklers.png" alt="Sprinkler Irrigation">
                <p>Sprinkler systems apply water over the crop through a network of pipes and nozzles, simulating rainfall.  It offers good coverage.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="technique">
                <h3>Suitable Conditions</h3>
                 <p>Best for: Undulating terrains, areas where water quality is moderately good.</p>
                <p>Crops: Cereals, vegetables, pastures, and fruit trees.</p>
                <p>Land Area: Medium to large fields.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="technique">
                <h3>Expenses & Resources</h3>
                <p>Initial Cost: Medium (pipes, sprinklers, pump).</p>
                <p>Resources: Water source, pump, and energy source,  Requires system design and pressure management.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="technique">
                <h3>Labor Needs</h3>
                <p>Medium labor for operation and maintenance. Requires some technical skill.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <img src="surface.png" alt="Surface Irrigation">
                <p>Water is applied to the soil surface and distributed by gravity.  Includes basin, border, and furrow irrigation. It's a traditional, low-tech method.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="technique">
                <h3>Suitable Conditions</h3>
                <p>Best for:  Relatively flat land with a consistent slope.</p>
                <p>Crops: Rice, wheat, sugarcane, and other close-growing crops.</p>
                 <p>Land Area: Large, leveled fields.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="technique">
                <h3>Expenses & Resources</h3>
                <p>Initial Cost: Low (land leveling may be required).</p>
                <p>Resources: Abundant water supply, land leveling, and channel construction.  May require significant water management.</p>
